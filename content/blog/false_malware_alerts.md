## Reasons

Most likely the problem is that the domain of this site contains the words `script` and `google`.

Hackers use Google Forms and Apps Script Web Apps to retrieve data. You can see how much posts has been generated about this in the [news].

## How to check

### Check the report

This is a public site with open source. You can find all code [here][contributorpw/google-apps-script-snippets-hugo-site].

Also it uses GitHub Pages technology [pages.github.com] for hosting.

You can check the folder `docs` of the `master` branch [here][master/docs]. There aren't even JavaScript files there.

### Check virustotal

Another way to check this site is to analize an url with VirusTotal.

Move to [VirusTotal detecton][virustotal_detection_site] for checking.
